          Selling panties on the internet doesn’t really sound like the start of
          a revolution.

          At least not when it’s compared to crypto. After all, DeFi and Web3
          were supposed to liberate us. Most of 2021 worked like an
          advertisement for this fledgling industry, painting it as the great
          panacea offering up a new wave of financial products designed to
          dissolve inequities across the social landscape – to bank the
          unbanked, to close the wage and investment gaps, to create
          opportunities for marginalized groups that they otherwise would never
          have access to...

          But instead of a righteous rebellion, we got Do Kwon, Su Zhu, SBF, and
          Caroline. We got unchecked greed that fucked over the masses - those
          of us who came into this space believing it was a brave new world just
          ended up becoming the exit liquidity for a select few.

          Now, in the wake of one of the most devastating unravelings that any
          industry has seen, some of us are still here wondering what the fuck
          we have left.

          You wanna know the truth? Art fucking matters. Paintings, culture,
          music, and jpegs can cause a revolution in a way that quant trading
          never could.

          PussyDAO is an experiment designed to bring punk rock and
          hyperfemininity into web3 – a social commentary delivering high art
          and fashion into a brand new universe. We’re developing an entirely
          new model for retail: one that’s based on limited drops of fashion,
          software, games, and objets d’art.

          This project is designed to instill NFTs with newfound utility: to
          start a new wave of digital fashion that empowers our community to
          play a fundamental role in the movement we’re creating. Every drop we
          do is intended to incite meaningful conversations – to touch on topics
          that most insist on leaving untouched: sex, power, control, identity,
          gender, and femininity, and how each of these subjects manifests
          across our financial landscape and in our own consumer behavior.

          Which brings us back to the panties: ours just happen to say “highly
          liquid” on the crotch. That’s because liquidity matters in more ways
          than one. Not only are we flipping off the crypto oligarchy that left
          us for dead – we’re engaging in a commentary on power that’s set to
          question the way we operate on a daily basis.

          After all, if we’re selling panties on the internet – and capitalizing
          off of the male gaze – it’s almost impossible to avoid asking, “Are we
          really the ones in control?” If we’re talking about money, it’s almost
          impossible to ignore the conversation around sex. At the same time, by
          taking something as symbolic as lingerie and deciding to own every
          element of our product (including the connotations that lie therein),
          we’re unapologetically embodying the female gaze – something that’s
          raw, feral, girly, glowy, bright, gritty, dreamy, sexy, a little bit
          wild, and wholly powerful.
