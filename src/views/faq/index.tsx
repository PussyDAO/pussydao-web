            PussyDAO is an experiment by Highly Liquid Inc. ‚Äì a next-generation
            apparel and product brand backed by emerging technologies. In the
            coming months, we‚Äôll be releasing a series of limited-edition drops
            across different mediums: fashion, software, games, food, and CPG.
            You can think of us like a girly Mr. Beast: a project that‚Äôs set to

            For our genesis drop, aka, The Panty Drop, we‚Äôre doing a collection
            of 1,000 IRL panties backed by NFTs: 100 on Solana and 900 on
            Ethereum. Every pair of panties says ‚Äúhighly liquid‚Äù on the crotch.

            After minting, holders will be able to redeem their NFTs for IRL

            How does the minting process work?
          </HeaderTag>
          <ParagraphTag className='mb-4 text-xl'>
            The Panty Drop mint will go down in 3 phases: the pre-mint, the
            mint, and the redemption process.
          </ParagraphTag>
          <ParagraphTag className='mb-4 text-xl'>
            By pre-minting your NFT, you guarantee that you‚Äôll be 1 of our 1,000
            holders and also get your NFT at a discount from the official mint
            day price. Every pre-mint NFT looks the same, and no rarity traits
            will be revealed until mint day. On mint day, your pre-mint NFT
            metadata will change to your official PussyDAO NFT. If you miss out
            on the pre-mint, you can still make it onto the Pink List. This will
            allow you to mint on our official mint day, and you‚Äôll get an NFT
            with rarity traits that will be revealed as soon as you mint.
          </ParagraphTag>
          <ParagraphTag className='mb-4 text-xl'>
            Once our official mint day is over, we‚Äôll start our redemption
            period ‚Äì the six-month period where holders have the chance to
            redeem their NFTs for IRL panties. After you redeem your NFT, your
            metadata will change once again. But don‚Äôt worry ‚Äì it‚Äôll still look
            dope af.

            Why are you guys doing a pre-mint?
          </HeaderTag>
          <ParagraphTag className='mb-4 text-xl'>
            Let‚Äôs face it: mints suck rn. First of all, it‚Äôs almost impossible
            to pick a time slot for a mint that works well for every member of a
            global audience. On top of that, after you‚Äôve gone out of your way
            to clear your schedule so you can sit down and actually mint your
            NFT, you‚Äôre up against an army of bot spam that pretty much ruins
            the entire experience.
          </ParagraphTag>
          <ParagraphTag className='mb-4 text-xl'>
            Our solution? A pre-mint. Now, our die-hard fans have the
            opportunity to mint their PussyDAO NFT before the actual mint day,
            which means you can make sure you get your hands on your NFT instead
            of losing it to someone‚Äôs bot that can click faster than you. Plus,
            when you pre-mint, you‚Äôll get a discount on the actual mint price.

            NFTs for IRL panties. That means, for the price of one NFT, you‚Äôre

            and Marchesa. Ethical production was top of mind for us when we
            chose our manufacturing partner. We wanted our panties to represent
            what we stand for as a business and brand, and we‚Äôre grateful to be

            Additionally, our atelier has deep ties to luxury manufacturing,

            from Japan and premium satin sourced by specialists in Los Angeles.

            <a href='https://www.marchesa.com/'>MSCHF</a>. They custom-created
